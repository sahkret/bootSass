Hi, this is a great big mess, but it should all be functional!<br><br>We have a Bootstrapped HTML with just a few small examples thereof,<br> some custom Sass to go along with it,<br> as well as a hot jQuery plugin for modal functionality,<br> all minified, with sourcemapping,<br> and added to Gulp build and watch functions.<br><br>Now fight me!
